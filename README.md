# testcasegenerator

IDEA:
1. I will be making a wide range test case generator for various types of questions 
2. it will cover various types of standards question

Problem usually faced:
I misses out some corner cases and big test cases ... which I will try to cover upto 80-90% which will increase the accuracy.
